A remake of a non-profit organization lead by ICPDAS USA CEO's wife. This website was originally made with PHP and hosted on GoDaddy. In the attempt to minimize spending on the website and provide security to the information of the organization, I pitched my idea to use my set of skills to develop a faster and secure website using Next.js 13 and TailwindCSS.

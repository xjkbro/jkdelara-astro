A simplified version of my portfolio. The portfolio I initially had at jkdelara.com had too much going on as I was also trying out new technology and experimenting with different designs. So I made something performant and easy to maintain. Astro proved to be the best option. I also wanted to try out Astro and see how it compares to NextJS.

This will later be used for a landing page for jkbro.dev, a brand for me.

Because of the struggle of landing a job in the web development industry, I thought why don't I try and express myself and teach people programming. So I thought of different ways to approach what I want to do and I have finally found a way to produce content and a way to advertise and market my brand. I thought it was best to create a website that would have the intention for actual real world use by using the Headless CMS, SanityIO to process the different videos I will produce and create post everytime I have a new video or course up. I want to apply and use this to feature other interesting things in my life such as fitness and fishkeeping. The JAMStack project was done with NextJS, TailwindCSS, Styled Components and SanityIO.

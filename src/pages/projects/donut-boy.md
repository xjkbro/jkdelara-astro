My goal was to create a game with ThreeJS with the knowledge that I have learned in the first two chapters of ThreeJS Journey. I decided to create a donut packing game where the player must pack as many donuts as possible into a box. The game is over when the player misses 3 donuts. Try to beat my high score of 29!

My feature project that I wish to build as my skills grow. MaxReps is a MERN stack web application that is meant to help fitness enthusiast to record their fitness goals while in the gym. Users are able to create an account, login, and view their workouts that they recorded by date. Please feel free to try out the application. If you don't want to create an account, here is a test account you can use.

Due to Heroku Removing their Free Tier, the demo is not completely available at the moment and will be working on putting it back up. I have a backup that allows you to just login and view the current data. You are unable to interact with the database as of right now.

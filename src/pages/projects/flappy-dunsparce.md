Mintbean.io's August 2021 Hackathon had tasked me and other programmers to create their very own 2-D video game in 1 week. There was no restrictions to creating the game as you could use a game engine, you could start from scratch and build without any form of engine and basic programming elements. I went with using a game engine called Parser to do this project and fell into doing a Flappy Birds clone that stars the Pokemon Dunsparce. The project was also created with React in the front end after the game was complete.

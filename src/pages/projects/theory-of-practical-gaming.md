A NextJS project that shows off my UI Design ability and my ability to transform an idea into a reality. This is one of many mock ups of a design for the esports organization I wanted to start a while back with friends. It features many interesting things about the company, the teams, an ecommerce section to sell merch and a partnership page to allow applications to join the team. The website is still a work in progress but will soon be live and will be used officially for the TPG website.

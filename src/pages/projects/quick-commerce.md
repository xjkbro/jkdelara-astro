I was testing ecommerce strategies with SQL and PHP and thought why not just do this with NextJS. With that in mind, I had to learn Authentication strategies and Querying SQL in a node application. I had to learn Prisma and Next Auth and as a quick way to set up payments, I used Stripe. This was a quick ecommerce solution I thought of and was happy about it since it took 4 days to really spin up everything in a way that could work beautifully for any startup business.

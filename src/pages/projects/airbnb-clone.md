My first JAMStack approach. Project was a lot of fun trying to work with a powerful headless CMS other than WordPress. I got to use NextJS, framework I'm really starting to get used to for such a unique build. All elements were planned based on how the data is structured in the Sanity studio by creating schemas. From there, I created the front end and developed the elements that make the icon Airbnb loadout with a cluster map with the help of the Google Maps API

A NextJS/Firebase project that allows users who log in using their Google accounts can instant message other users who log in using google. First time approaching a project using NextJS and Firebase. I learned a lot and can continue to improve aspects of the app. There's a lot of room to turn the project into a full fledge everyday public application.

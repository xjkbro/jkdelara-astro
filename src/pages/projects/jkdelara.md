Trying to get ahead of the game and understand NextJS and their most recent update, version 13, brings loads of new features and changes to NextJS. Many of which are still in beta but it's great to start testing and getting used to new features to become a better developer. On top of that, I really needed to update my website/portfolio and use tools that will help improve performance, have better SEO and a more simple design. Prior I had used no frameworks to create my portfolio. Check it in the links below. It was cool and unique but really was lacking attention to usability and was bad to update by having to commit to the repo every time I had a new project to post.

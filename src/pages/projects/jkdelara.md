I found it a pain to use a headless CMS especially Strapi, which I used for my previous version of my portfolio. Strapi turned out to be a hassle. I've lost many posts because I would disconnect from the internet time to time having me to retype things if I didn't save, it required me to find a place to host and with the little content I had, I thought it wasn't worth dishing $5 a month just to host something that I could have as content on my repository for free, querying information for posts is garbage ( don't get me started on Sanity's, that's why I didn't choose it in the first place). There's just been problem after problem and I'm done with it and moving to content hosted on my repository. I also decided to make the switch to Astro. Nextjs is overkill for what I need.

## Version 3 - depricated 6/26/23

Trying to get ahead of the game and understand NextJS and their most recent update, version 13, brings loads of new features and changes to NextJS. Many of which are still in beta but it's great to start testing and getting used to new features to become a better developer. On top of that, I really needed to update my website/portfolio and use tools that will help improve performance, have better SEO and a more simple design. Prior I had used no frameworks to create my portfolio. Check it in the links below. It was cool and unique but really was lacking attention to usability and was bad to update by having to commit to the repo every time I had a new project to post.

Version 2 was done with Vanilla JS and CSS. It's focus was to target mobile first with a different way to navigate a portfolio. The switch to v3 was because I wanted to do a blog.

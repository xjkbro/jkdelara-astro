A personal project for an imaginary tea shop to use the skills we acquired during the bootcamp. With the demo in the link below, includes the use of many Bootstrap elements along with React, React Strap and Animations. In the bootcamp, we were also taught to transform our current application and make it a mobile application using React Native.

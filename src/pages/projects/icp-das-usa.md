ICP DAS USA Inc is the website that I helped polish, redesign, optimized and manage day to day for my company. The website is my current employer's official website and owns many other small businesses LSJTech, eAthenaTech, and UVGenie that I also manage. This website in particular is a PHP based website build in 2007 with a custom CMS using MySQL to hold content for our 2000+ products that we offer, newsletters, press releases, articles, support software and drivers, webinars, etc. The website has had many iterations of changes over the years and recently, the new design changes were done by me.

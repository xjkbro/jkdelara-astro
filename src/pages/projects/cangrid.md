A JAMStack project using NextJS and Firebase that will allow users to upload their photos to a universal gallery and share with others (the main page) and have a private gallery for their own uploads and everyone view it by a dynamic subdomain. Uploads are only processed by logging in and authenticating via Google. Users are also able to view individual upload and do the following: like, comment, read caption, view tags, read comments and read the exif meta data that comes from the uploaded image. The application is essentially a full fledged social media platform that allows users to share photos however the please. Please give my application a try. NEW ADDITIONS: Like Button, Night Mode, Mobile Styling

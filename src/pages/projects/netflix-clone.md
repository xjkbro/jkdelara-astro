A ReactJS, Redux, and Firebase project that resembles everyones favorite movie streaming service Netflix. The app is part of a course to learn and produce full scale applications with a front end element of react, redux with managing user data, firebase for backend and deployment. Obviously, it will not have video playback functionality but it behaves like Netflix's official website.

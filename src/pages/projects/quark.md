Quark is a particle engine/library that I helped create with a few peers for our University's Engineering Senior Design competition. We were tasked to create a particle engine with our professors Evidence based language Quorum. Basically everything from scratch except the objects used, we created a functional library with particle and particle emitter properties and a particle editor that creates and saves properties of a particle via JSON. Unfortunately, we did not win the competition we did get approved to include the library to our professor's language.
